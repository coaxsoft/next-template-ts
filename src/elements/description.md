# elements

elements components, also known as reusable components, are a vital aspect of React. They allow developers to write a piece of code once and use it in multiple places across the application, enhancing the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

A elements component is a self-contained unit of code that encapsulates its own logic and view. It can accept parameters (props), allowing it to have different configurations depending on where it is used.

example button, input, radio, checkbox, etc.
