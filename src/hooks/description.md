# hooks

In a React project, a hooks folder is often used to store custom React Hooks. Custom Hooks are a feature of React that allow you to reuse stateful logic between different components without repeating the same code.

React provides several built-in Hooks like useState, useEffect, and useContext, among others. However, sometimes these are not enough for specific tasks, or they need to be used in combination for various features. In these cases, custom Hooks can be very useful.
