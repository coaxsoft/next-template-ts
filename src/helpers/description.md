# helpers

In JavaScript, helper functions are often a set of functions that perform a specific task and can be used across different parts of an application. They help in reducing code redundancy and making the code more readable and maintainable.

Helper functions can be organized in a single file (often named as helpers.js or a dedicated helper directory) and can be imported wherever they're needed.
